# Hdl21 Schematics VsCode Extension

* To build the extension into a standalone `.vsix` file: 
  * `yarn package`

* To run the VsCode extension debug server: 
  * Launch *this* folder in VsCode. Not its parent or their parents; VSC really wants the "extension root" directory. 
  * `yarn watch` to compile in watch mode.
  * `F5` to launch the extension in debug mode.
